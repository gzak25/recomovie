# RecoMovie, Movie Recommendation System
### By Vaani Bhatnagar, and Gabriel Zak

## Introduction
This project aims to develop a movie recommendation system that suggests films based on inputted user preferences: favorite movie and exploration percentage. The program scrapes movie data, processes it, and applies a genre-based recommendation algorithm.

## Problem Statement
Users often struggle to find movies that match their interests. Existing recommendation systems may not balance personalization and exploration. This project seeks to develop an approach that provides relevant recommendations while allowing users to explore new genres.

## Related Work
Many movie recommendation systems use collaborative filtering or content-based filtering. This project builds on content-based filtering by incorporating a graph-based genre exploration method, allowing controlled genre diversification in recommendations.

## How to Use
1. Run `movie_recommender.ipynb` and enter your favorite movie.
2. Enter your Exploration Percentage between 0-100. The higher the percentage, the more diverse genre movie recommendations you will get.
3. View the list of your top five recommended movies and enjoy!

## How it Works
The methodology involves three main steps:
1. **Scraping movie data** from Box Office Mojo (movie titles and corresponding genres) and Rotten Tomatoes (movie titles and corresponding ratings).
2. **Processing and structuring the data** into a unified dataset using a hashmap.
3. **Implementing a genre-based recommendation algorithm** with an adjustable exploration parameter using graphs and Breadth-First Search (BFS). The program:
   - Takes user input (favorite movie and exploration percentage).
   - Matches the movie in the hashmap (using fuzzy matching for minor spelling errors).
   - Uses BFS to explore related genres based on exploration percentage.
   - Recommends the top five rated movies.

## Implementation Details
### Data Collection
Movie data was scraped from Box Office Mojo (top-grossing films) and Rotten Tomatoes (ratings) using BeautifulSoup and requests. The data was stored in JSON files as hashmaps.

### Data Processing
Extracted genre lists were standardized, and movie ratings were integrated into a unified hashmap.

### Recommendation Algorithm
- A **genre graph** was built where nodes represent genres and edges connect related genres.
- BFS was applied to explore genres up to a specified depth, based on the user-defined exploration percentage.
- Candidate movies were selected based on genre similarity and ranked by rating.

## Results
The system successfully generates movie recommendations based on user input. Users control the balance between strictly matching genres and exploring new ones:
- **0-25% exploration**: Recommendations closely match the input movieâ€™s genre.
- **25-50% exploration**: Includes movies from adjacent genres (BFS depth = 1).
- **50-75% exploration**: Includes movies from farther genres (BFS depth = 2).
- **75-100% exploration**: Includes movies from different genres (BFS depth = 3).
- **Genre graph visualization** provides insights into genre interconnections.

## Discussion
Compared to traditional content-based filtering, this approach allows user-defined flexibility in recommendation diversity. The BFS-based genre exploration ensures controlled expansion beyond immediate preferences. Some limitations include:
- Dependence on the accuracy of genre classification.
- Potential bias due to dataset limitations.
- The need for periodic updates to include new movies.

## Reflections
This project demonstrated the feasibility of a genre-graph-based recommendation system. Future improvements could include integrating user ratings, leveraging machine learning techniques, and expanding the dataset to include streaming services.

## Conclusion
This project presents an innovative approach to movie recommendations using genre graphs and BFS exploration. By allowing users to define exploration levels, the system provides both relevance and diversity in recommendations.
